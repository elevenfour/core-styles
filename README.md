# Core Styles

The Core styles for WoltLab Suite™ are a collection of free styles that do not rely on images, templates or even extra CSS. These styles are based on the original Core style by WoltLab - the only thing that's changed: The color palette. In other words: These styles are as fast as WoltLab Suite™ can get and highly compatible.
